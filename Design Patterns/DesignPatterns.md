# What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide a standard way of solving certain types of problems, and they allow software developers to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable software systems.

Design patterns were first introduced in the 1990s by the Gang of Four (GoF), a group of software engineers who identified a set of recurring patterns in software development. Since then, many other design patterns have been identified and documented.

There are three main categories of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral. Creational patterns deal with object creation, structural patterns deal with object composition, and behavioral patterns deal with communication between objects.

Some examples of common design patterns include the Singleton pattern, the Factory pattern, the Observer pattern, and the Strategy pattern. These patterns have been widely adopted in many programming languages and frameworks, and they are considered best practices in software development.

# How to use Design Patterns?

To use design patterns in programming, you need to understand the problem you are trying to solve and the pattern that best fits that problem. Here are some steps to follow:

Identify the problem you are trying to solve: Before you can apply a design pattern, you need to have a clear understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.

Choose the appropriate design pattern: Once you have identified the problem, you need to choose the appropriate design pattern that best fits the problem.

Implement the design pattern: After choosing the appropriate design pattern, you can begin implementing it in your code. You should follow the guidelines provided by the pattern to ensure that your implementation is correct.

Test and refine: After implementing the design pattern, you should test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. If necessary, you may need to refine your implementation to make it more efficient or to address any issues that arise during testing.

Document your code: Finally, it is important to document your code, especially when using design patterns. This will make it easier for other developers to understand your code and to maintain it in the future.

Overall, using design patterns requires a good understanding of the problem you are trying to solve and the patterns that are available to solve it. With practice, you can become proficient in using design patterns to build reliable and maintainable software systems.

# What are the Most common Design Patterns?

## Creational Patterns

1. Abstract Factory - provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes

2. Builder - separates the construction of a complex object from its representation

3. Factory Method - defines an interface for creating objects, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate

4. Prototype - specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype

5. Singleton - ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it

## Structural Patterns

1. Adapter - converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect

2. Bridge - decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently

3. Composite - composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies

4. Decorator - attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically

5. Facade - provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem

6. Flyweight - minimizes memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects

7. Proxy - provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it


## Behavioral Patterns

1. Chain of Responsibility - allows multiple objects to handle a request, each handling a part of the request chain, and passing it along to the next handler if necessary

2. Command - encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations

3. Interpreter - defines a representation for grammar in a language and an interpreter to interpret the grammar

4. Iterator - provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation

5. Mediator - defines simplified communication between classes by having them communicate through a mediator object

6. Memento - allows an object to capture its current internal state and save it to be restored later

7. Observer - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

8. State - allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes

9. Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable

10. Template Method - defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses

11. Visitor - lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates


These patterns can be applied in various programming languages and frameworks to solve different types of problems. It is important to note that not all of these patterns will be applicable in every situation, and choosing the appropriate pattern requires careful consideration of the problem at hand.

# Not so common Design Patterns

It is also worth mentioning that there are several other design patterns that are not as widely recognized as the 23 patterns mentioned above, but are still useful in certain situations. Some of these lesser-known design patterns include:

## Creational Patterns

1. Dependency Injection - allows objects to be created and their dependencies to be injected at runtime

2. Object Pool - creates a pool of reusable objects that can be shared among clients

3. Lazy Initialization - defers the creation of an object until it is actually needed


## Structural Patterns
1. Private Class Data - restricts access to an object's data by making it private and providing access through public methods

2. Proxy - provides a way to control access to an object without exposing its implementation details

3. Module - organizes code into self-contained units that can be easily reused and tested

## Behavioral Patterns

1. Chain of Command - decouples the sender of a request from its receiver by allowing multiple objects to handle the request

2. Null Object - provides a default implementation for an interface that does nothing, allowing the client code to handle null values gracefully

3. Servant - allows clients to access a group of related objects through a single interface

4. Specification - separates the specification of business rules from their implementation, allowing the rules to be easily changed or extended


As with the more well-known design patterns, the key to using these patterns effectively is to understand the problem you are trying to solve and to choose the pattern that best fits that problem. By using design patterns, you can build software systems that are more maintainable, reusable, and scalable, and that are better able to meet the needs of your users.
