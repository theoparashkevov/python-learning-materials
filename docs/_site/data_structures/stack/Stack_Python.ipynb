    "A stack is a linear data structure characterized by its LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle. It is an ordered collection of elements where the addition and removal of elements occur only at one end, known as the top of the stack. The stack follows a strict policy of element insertion and removal through its top, implying that the last element added to the stack is the first to be removed. This structure can be implemented as an abstract data type that provides operations to manipulate its contents."

    "Stacks find extensive usage across various domains due to their efficiency and simplicity. They are commonly utilized for solving problems involving reversing or undoing operations. The stack data structure is integral in parsing expressions, implementing recursive algorithms, evaluating postfix expressions, and backtracking through recursive depth-first search algorithms. Furthermore, stacks are fundamental in the implementation of run-time call stacks in programming languages, enabling function calls and their respective return addresses to be stored and managed efficiently. The versatility and utility of the stack data structure make it a fundamental component in algorithm design and analysis.\n"
