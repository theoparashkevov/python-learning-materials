## Getting Started

If you are new to Python, start with the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. It provides a hands-on introduction to Python programming and covers the basics of the language, including data types, control structures, functions, and classes.

You will also need to install Python on your computer. We recommend using the latest version of Python 3, which you can download from the official Python website.

## Code Examples

The code_examples directory contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques. Each script is self-contained and can be run independently. We encourage you to study the code and experiment with it to deepen your understanding of Python.

## Exercises

The exercises directory contains a set of Python exercises for you to practice your skills. Each exercise comes with a set of instructions and a sample solution. Try to solve the exercise on your own first, and then compare your solution to the sample solution. You can also use the exercises as a starting point for your own projects.

## Projects

The projects directory contains a set of Python projects for you to build. Each project comes with a set of requirements and a sample solution. Use the projects as an opportunity to apply your Python skills to real-world problems and to explore new areas of programming.
