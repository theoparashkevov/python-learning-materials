# What are Component Cohesion Principles?

Component cohesion principles in programming refer to the concept of designing software components in a way that ensures each component has a single, well-defined responsibility or purpose. There are several different principles of component cohesion that developers can follow to achieve this goal:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This principle states that a component should have only one reason to change. In other words, it should have a single responsibility or function that it performs.

2. Common Closure Principle (CCP): This principle states that components that change together should be grouped together. This means that components that are closely related should be placed in the same module or package.

3. Common Reuse Principle (CRP): This principle states that components that are not tightly related should not be grouped together. Instead, they should be kept separate so that they can be reused independently.

4. Acyclic Dependencies Principle (ADP): This principle states that there should be no cycles in the dependencies between components. This means that a component should not depend on another component that also depends on it, creating a circular dependency.

By following these principles, developers can design software components that are easy to understand, maintain, and modify. Components with high cohesion are also more reusable and less likely to introduce bugs or errors into a system.
